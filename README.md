# Alternative FIWARE IoT-Frontend [![MIT license](http://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-lightgrey.svg)](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

This project aims at providing a high-performance alternative to FIWARE components IDAS and Cygnus.

The idea is to receive sensor values using ultralight protocol and besides sending them to ORION to 
directly storing them as time series data in a mongo database.

The project is currently in a very early stage. Documentation will be coming soon.
